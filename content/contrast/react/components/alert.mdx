# React Bootstrap 5 Alerts

React Bootstrap 5 Alerts keep track of any changes that happen on the website and provide feedbacks messages to users after specific actions are carried out. 

With React Bootstrap 5 Alerts we call users attention to certain things as alerts are usually top and center of a webpage, making them a hard to miss, they are really easy to create and even easier with the React Bootstrap 5 library.

## Importing the Contrast Alert Component

Contrast Alerts are available for any length of text, as well as an optional dismiss button. 

To use the Contrast Alerts in your project, we start by importing the `CDBAlert` component in your project.

```js
import { CDBAlert } from "cdbreact";

```

## Default Alerts

We create alerts with the Contrast library by wrapping the content we want to alert our users with the `CDBAlert` component. To define the background color of our alert, we set the `color` prop on the `CDBAlert` component to the color code we want our alert to have (e.g. primary, secondary, success etc.)



  <div
    class="alert alert-primary"
    style="width: 100%;"
    role="alert"
  >
    A straightforward alert with a React Boostrap (contrast)design. Take a look!
  </div>
  <div
    class="alert alert-secondary"
    style="width: 100%"
    role="alert"
  >
    A straightforward alert with a React Boostrap (contrast)design. Take a look!
  </div>
  <div
    class="alert alert-success"
    style="width: 100%"
    role="alert"
  >
   A straightforward alert with a React Boostrap (contrast)design. Take a look!
  </div>
  <div
    class="alert alert-danger"
    style="width: 100%"
    role="alert"
  >
     A straightforward alert with a React Boostrap (contrast)design. Take a look!
  </div>
  <div
    class="alert alert-warning"
    style="width: 100%"
    role="alert"
  >
     A straightforward alert with a React Boostrap (contrast)design. Take a look!
  </div>
  <div class="alert alert-info" style="width: 100%" role="alert">
     A straightforward alert with a React Boostrap (contrast)design. Take a look!
  </div>

  <div class="alert alert-dark" style="width: 100%" role="alert">
     A straightforward alert with a React Boostrap (contrast)design. Take a look!
  </div>

```js
import React from "react";
import { CDBAlert, CDBContainer } from "cdbreact";

const Alert = () => {
  return (
    <CDBContainer>
        <CDBAlert color="primary">
           A straightforward alert with a React Boostrap (contrast)design. Take a look!
        </CDBAlert>
        <CDBAlert color="secondary">
           A straightforward alert with a React Boostrap (contrast)design. Take a look!
        </CDBAlert>
        <CDBAlert color="success">
           A straightforward alert with a React Boostrap (contrast)design. Take a look!
        </CDBAlert>
        <CDBAlert color="danger">
           A straightforward alert with a React Boostrap (contrast)design. Take a look!
        </CDBAlert>
        <CDBAlert color="warning">
           A straightforward alert with a React Boostrap (contrast)design. Take a look!
        </CDBAlert>
        <CDBAlert color="dark">
           A straightforward alert with a React Boostrap (contrast)design. Take a look!
        </CDBAlert>
    </CDBContainer>
  );
};

export default Alert;
```

## Additional Content

Sometimes we want our webpages to pop and add more context to the text or message we want our alert to convey, we can do all of that with the React Bootstrap 5 alerts (Contrast) gives us.

Our React bootstrap alert can also contain additional HTML elements like headings, paragraphs and dividers.


  <div
    class="alert alert-primary"
    style="width: 100%;"
    role="alert"
  >
    <h4 class="alert-heading">Well done!</h4>
    <p>You did, indeed, read this important alert message. This example text will be a little longer so you can see how spacing within an alert works with this type of content.</p>
    <hr></hr>
    <p class="mb-0">Use margin utilities whenever possible to keep things neat and tidy.</p>
  </div>


```js
import React from "react";
import { CDBAlert, CDBContainer } from "cdbreact";

const Alert = () => {
  return (
    <CDBContainer>
        <CDBAlert color="primary">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Well done!</h4>
            <p>You did, indeed, read this important alert message. This example text will be a little longer so you can see how spacing within an alert works with this type of content</p>
            <hr/>
            <p class="mb-0">Use margin utilities whenever possible to keep things neat and tidy</p>
        </CDBAlert>
    </CDBContainer>
  );
};

export default Alert;
```

##  Contrast Dismissing

Using the React Bootstrap Alert component, you can dismiss any alert inline by adding the `dismiss` prop. Below is a live action demo.

<div>
    <div
      class="alert alert-danger alert-dismissible fade show"
      role="alert"
    >
      <strong>Holy guacamole!</strong> You should check in on some of the fields listed below.
      <button
        type="button"
        class="btn-close"
        data-dismiss="alert"
        aria-label="Close"
      ></button>
    </div>
  </div>

```js
import React from "react";
import { CDBAlert, CDBContainer } from "cdbreact";

const Alert = () => {
  return (
    <CDBContainer>
      <CDBAlert color="danger" dismiss>
        <strong>Holy guacamole!</strong> You should check in on some of the fields listed below.
      </CDBAlert>
    </CDBContainer>
  );
};

export default Alert;
```
